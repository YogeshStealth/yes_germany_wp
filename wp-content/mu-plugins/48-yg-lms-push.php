 * Plugin Name: YG mh Lead Delivery (CRM + LMS)
 * Description: Makes enquiries submitted from mh.yesgermany.com reach both downstream systems. The CRM push in 45-yg-lead-crm-push.php runs in the browser by default, off CF7's JS events - neither of which exists on mh - so mh leads were never reaching it; this forces that push server-side for mh only. It also forwards to the LMS lead-widget, which is a separate system from the CRM and does not receive its leads (verified 24 Sep 2026).

 * altogether - which would silently drop the lead from the LMS. Referer is kept

/*
 * Why the CRM is NOT pushed from here.
 *
 * The obvious fix for mh was to force 45-yg-lead-crm-push.php onto its
 * server-side transport, since mh never loads that plugin's browser script and
 * never fires the CF7 JS events it listens for. That was tried on 24 Sep 2026
 * and fails at the network layer:
 *
 *   cURL error 7: Failed to connect to yesgermany.org:8443 after 1 ms
 *
 * Outbound TCP 8443 is refused from this web server - immediately, so it is a
 * firewall rule, not a timeout. Port 443 to the same host and 443 to the LMS
 * both open fine. That is almost certainly why the CRM push was written to run
 * in the visitor's browser in the first place.
 *
 * So mh pushes the CRM from the browser too, in its own form.js, exactly as the
 * main site does. The CRM allows it: a cross-origin POST from
 * https://mh.yesgermany.com returns Access-Control-Allow-Origin for that origin
 * and creates the lead.
 *
 * If the host ever opens outbound 8443, the better arrangement is to set
 * YG_LEAD_API_TRANSPORT to 'server' in wp-config.php, which moves the CRM push
 * server-side for every install at once and removes the dependency on the
 * visitor's browser staying open. The transport filter added to mu-plugin 45
 * makes that a one-line change.
